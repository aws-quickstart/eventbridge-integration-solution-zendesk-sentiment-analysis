## Amazon EventBridge Intergration Solution: Zendesk Sentiment Anaylsis

This Quick Start demonstrates an integration with AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda for Amazon EventBridge SaaS Partner Integrations. This solution is triggered by a ticket creation event from Zendesk. An EventBridge rule then evaluates the event and invokes an AWS Step Function if event conditions match. You can use this as a starter project to extend this solution for any scenario that can be run through a Step Function workflow.
